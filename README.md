Test for Docler
The exercise I solved with just few checks in Google, which was intentionally. 

Latest Chromedriver.exe (latest for the time of the upload) is attached inside of the solution.

In order to run the tests, I think that it will be sufficient to download the project and open the Docler.POM.sln file in Visual Studio.

Test cases are inside the Visual Studio project TestCases(GherkinStyle).txt and TestCases(Standart).html. Test cases are in Given/When/Then format - covering the requirements and the second file contains standart format.
