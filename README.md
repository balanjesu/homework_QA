Test for Docler
The exercise I solved with just few checks in Google, which was intentionally. I don't want to show you guys something which I don't know so this is why I have decided to do it this way. Nevertheless I'm eager to learn and start a career as an automation tester! I just need someone to give me the chance to prove that I'm worth it!

Latest Chromedriver.exe (latest for the time of the upload) is attached inside of the solution.

In order to run the tests, I think that it will be sufficient to download the project and open the Docler.POM.sln file in Visual Studio.

Test cases are inside the Visual Studio project TestCases(GherkinStyle).txt and TestCases(Standart).html. Test cases are in Given/When/Then format - covering the requirements and the second file contains standart format.
